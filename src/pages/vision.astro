      <h2>The Third Plane of Development</h2>
      <p>
        Maria Montessori identified adolescence (ages 12–18) as the <strong>third plane of development</strong> — a period
        as transformative as the first six years of life. During this plane, the young person undergoes a profound
        social rebirth, seeking to understand their place in the world and their contribution to society.
      </p>
      <p>
        The adolescent is driven by a need for <em>social belonging</em>, <em>moral understanding</em>, and
        <em>economic independence</em>. Traditional schooling often fails to meet these deep developmental needs,
        leaving young people disengaged and disconnected.

      <h2>Erdkinder: The Land School</h2>
      <p>
        Montessori envisioned the <strong>Erdkinder</strong> — literally "children of the earth" — as the ideal
        environment for adolescent education. This concept centers on a farm-based living community where adolescents engage
        in meaningful work: growing food, managing a store, running a guest house, and participating in the
        economic life of a community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this real-world engagement, adolescents develop self-confidence, practical skills, and a deep
        understanding of their interdependence with others and the natural world.
        We refer to this prepared environment for adolescents as a Center of Study and Work or a Living Community.

      <h2>Nurturing the Whole Person</h2>
      <p>
        Our vision extends beyond academics. We believe in nurturing the <strong>intellectual</strong>,
        <strong>emotional</strong>, <strong>social</strong>, and <strong>moral</strong> development of every
        adolescent. Montessori education at this level asks:
      </p>
      <ul class="vision-list">
        <li>How can we honour the adolescent's need for dignity and respect?</li>
        <li>How do we create environments where young people feel safe to explore their identity?</li>
        <li>How can meaningful work replace passive learning?</li>
        <li>How do we prepare adolescents not just for exams, but for life?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="vision-section">
      <h2>A Global Movement</h2>
      <p>
        Across the world, educators are answering these questions. From urban Montessori high schools to rural
        Erdkinder programs, a movement is growing — one that takes seriously Montessori's insight that the
        adolescent years are not a problem to be managed, but a <em>gift to be nurtured</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are dedicated to supporting this movement through shared resources, research, and community.
