      <h2>A Unique Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Montessori pedagogy offers a profound understanding of adolescent development. But it doesn't have to
        stand alone. Our work draws on <strong>Montessori philosophy</strong> alongside other wellness
        practices like <strong>mindfulness</strong>, <strong>social/emotional learning</strong>, and other
        holistic traditions to support the whole human — not just the student.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't an alternative to AMI training. It's something <em>complementary</em> — a bridge between
        Montessori's vision for adolescents and the broader landscape of human development wisdom.

      <h2>What This Looks Like</h2>
      <p>
        We believe adolescent development spans every dimension of being. Our approach nurtures growth across:

        <div class="dimension">
          <h3>Intellectual</h3>
          <p>Critical thinking, curiosity, and the capacity for abstract reasoning that emerges in the third plane.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="dimension">
          <h3>Emotional</h3>
          <p>Self-awareness, resilience, and the ability to navigate the intense emotional landscape of adolescence.</p>

          <p>Belonging, collaboration, and understanding one's role within the community and the wider world.</p>

        <div class="dimension">
          <h3>Physical</h3>
          <p>Connection to the body, meaningful physical work, and practices that honor the adolescent's changing form.</p>

          <h3>Moral</h3>
          <p>A developing sense of justice, responsibility, and the courage to act on one's values.</p>

      <h2>The Bridge</h2>
      <p>
        Maria Montessori understood that adolescents need more than academic instruction. They need environments
        that honor the whole of who they are becoming. Practices like mindfulness and social/emotional learning
        have long recognized what Montessori intuited — that the intellectual, emotional, and physical are not
        separate but deeply interconnected.
      </p>
      <p>
        By weaving these traditions together, we create a richer, more complete framework for supporting
        adolescents through one of the most transformative periods of their lives.
