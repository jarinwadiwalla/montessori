      <h2>The Gap</h2>
      <p>
        An AMI 12-18 Diploma training can cost more than €13,000, especially if you have to travel multiple times to your training center for extended stays. For many communities around the world —
        communities that already live the principles of interdependence, meaningful work, and connection to the land —
        that price tag puts formal Montessori programming out of reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that shouldn't be the end of the story. Some of the communities that would benefit most from
        Montessori adolescent education are the ones least able to afford it. That's the gap we exist to close.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        We raise funds and build partnerships to bring Montessori-inspired adolescent programming to
        <strong>under-resourced communities</strong> — especially those that already embody these values organically.
        We don't arrive with a model to impose. We arrive with resources, training, and hands to help build
        what the community envisions.

      <p>
        Every contribution helps bring Montessori wisdom to communities that have never had the opportunity.
        This is how we build a more equitable world — one adolescent program at a time.
