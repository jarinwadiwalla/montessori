      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Montessori for Adolescents exists to advance the understanding and practice of Montessori education
        for young people aged 12–18. We believe that Maria Montessori's insights into adolescent development
        are as relevant today as when she first articulated them — perhaps more so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through webinars, guides, and a growing network of global partners, we aim to support educators,
        parents, and school leaders in creating environments where adolescents can truly thrive.

      <h2>The Third Plane of Development</h2>
      <p>
        Maria Montessori identified adolescence (ages 12–18) as the <strong>third plane of development</strong> — a period
        as transformative as the first six years of life. During this plane, the young person undergoes a profound
        social rebirth, seeking to understand their place in the world and their contribution to society.
      </p>
      <p>
        The adolescent is driven by a need for <em>social belonging</em>, <em>moral understanding</em>, and
        <em>economic independence</em>. Traditional schooling often fails to meet these deep developmental needs,
        leaving young people disengaged and disconnected.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Erdkinder: The Land School</h2>
      <p>
        Montessori envisioned the <strong>Erdkinder</strong> — literally "children of the earth" — as the ideal
        environment for adolescent education. This concept centers on a farm-based living community where adolescents engage
        in meaningful work: growing food, managing a store, running a guest house, and participating in the
        economic life of a community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this real-world engagement, adolescents develop self-confidence, practical skills, and a deep
        understanding of their interdependence with others and the natural world.
        We refer to this prepared environment for adolescents as a Center of Study and Work or a Living Community.

      <h2>Nurturing the Whole Person</h2>
      <p>
        Our vision extends beyond academics. We believe in nurturing the <strong>intellectual</strong>,
        <strong>emotional</strong>, <strong>social</strong>, and <strong>moral</strong> development of every
        adolescent. Montessori education at this level asks:
      </p>
      <ul class="about-list">
        <li>How can we honour the adolescent's need for dignity and respect?</li>
        <li>How do we create environments where young people feel safe to explore their identity?</li>
        <li>How can meaningful work replace passive learning?</li>
        <li>How do we prepare adolescents not just for exams, but for life?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We are guided by three core principles:

        <div class="principle">
          <h3>Commitment to Montessori</h3>
          <p>
            We ground our work in Maria Montessori's original writings and vision, particularly her
            insights into the third plane of development as described in <em>From Childhood to Adolescence</em>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="principle">
          <h3>Global Perspective</h3>
          <p>
            Montessori education is a worldwide movement. We seek out and amplify diverse voices, approaches,
            and cultural contexts in adolescent Montessori education.
          </p>

        <div class="principle">
          <h3>Practical Wisdom</h3>
          <p>
            Theory matters, but so does practice. Our resources are designed to be immediately useful
            for educators and parents working with adolescents today.

      <h2>A Global Movement</h2>
      <p>
        Across the world, educators are answering these questions. From urban Montessori high schools to rural
        Erdkinder programs, a movement is growing — one that takes seriously Montessori's insight that the
        adolescent years are not a problem to be managed, but a <em>gift to be nurtured</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are dedicated to supporting this movement through shared resources, research, and community.
